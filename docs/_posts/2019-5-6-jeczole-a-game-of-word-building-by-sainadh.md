Hello guys, by seeing the title many of you have already got confused what the title means. I am going to guide you through the various elements and the way of playing it. In childhood we play as many games as possible both in indoor as well as outdoor. Coming to the indoor games we are familiar with snake and ladder, Chess, Ludo. But one game for sure we would have played in our most of the schooling times is “Word building”.

```
Taking the word building as a base, we the students of Featurepreneur community, 
have brought a game in which every one can participate 
and do well since it runs on the basic knowledge of the kollywood movies.
```

**Our Motto:**
```
In our community that is Featurepreneur, the way we follow is to learn with fun. 

Because it continuously needs our attention to participate 
and we would be definitely attentive in participating in the sessions organized by the community. 

In our community we concentrate on automating the gaming 
features of the local environment to get the peers engaged with work and fun. 

And for sure I can assure that one can stick to the work they start, 
when they have enough relaxation.
```

Here comes one of the best top rated games presented by the Featurepreneur community called Jeczole. Basically the title for the game is decided based on the another game called Mythraki designed by our community students. For more information on Mythraki refer to the medium article given link below.

**How Game functions:**

Interested to know how the game functions then lets go:

This game can be played as a team or even as an individual. We will be having three categories named Movies, Actor, Actress. Let’s suppose that 1st player has said the movie name “Master”, here the last letter of the movie is ‘r’. So the next player to him must submit a word related to movie or actor or actress which is starting with the letter ‘r’. It is the most important that one should start the word with end letter of the previous player.

**Elimination and tech Stuff:**

One can have a query about how the members of the game get eliminated. Here comes the interesting and techy part of the game Jeczole. By using the NLP we are going to classify the words submitted by user into the three categories mentioned above. If any of the list in the category crosses the limit of 10, then the player automatically gets eliminated from the game.

I.e in order to stay in the loop of the game one must ensure that they are not sticking to a particular category i.e is one should not say continuously movie or actor or actress names. If they do so they will be out of the game.

**Winner:**

The one who lasted long in this loop would be the winner. Here comes the rewarding part of the game. Unlike the classroom games here in our community we will reward the player with the Tact-Coins.
