summary: Collect the data like a Bee
---

The task was to create a feature to collect data from LinkedIn and store it in a database with vue.js as frontend and flask as backend.

**Requirements**

The requirement of the feature is to collect Name and About from LinkedIn and store it in a database. It is basically a CRUD operation.


Stack
* Flask -Backend
* Vue.js-Frontend
* MongoDB-Database

**Why this feature**

I love to explore new things. It can be anything technology, places, or food. So when I heard about VueJs I really want to learn and explore it. This is an interesting feature to work on because of various technologies.


**My squad**

We are just a team of two. Varsha and I learned many new things throughout the process. It was like the sea when we started but ended up with huge knowledge of the technologies. We also explored many things apart from our stack.


**Working Hours**

As we were totally new to vue.js, flask, and MongoDB. So we took the time to get a basic knowledge of the technologies. Then started working on the project. Total we spent 25 hours to complete the project.


**Hurdles in the project**

Connecting vue.js and flask was the big deal. We had no idea how to use flask as a backend. Then came to know about Axios and completed. The second most hurdle is to access the _id from MongoDB to update and delete data. In vue.js with a flask as backend, it is totally different.


**Phases**

We divided the work into three phases. Firstly designing a frontend with vue.js. The second phase is to connect the flask and frontend. Finally, the third phase is to connect the app with MongoDB. We successfully implemented all three phases.


**Tact Coins**

Finally, all those hurdles were awarded 14 thousand tact coins. Something to cheer us to do more. We were also curious about the next task.


Our app looks like this
