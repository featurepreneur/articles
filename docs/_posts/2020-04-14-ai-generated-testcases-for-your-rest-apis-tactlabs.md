summary: AI-Generated Testcases for your REST APIs
---

When the REST API concept introduced, most of the companies adopted it aggressively hence REST API becomes new normal for all web applications.


There comes Postman where you can create your own test cases in order to make sure your API works fine. However, applications keep improving things in their API, so they have to change their REST API regularly.


Whenever you change your API, you may need to write more testcases with the help of your tester/developer which costs much amount.


**Solution Time**


We have been there in the same place a couple of years ago and spent much amount on the testing. Then, we have decided to automate these test-cases by using AI algorithms. We have created a customized algorithm to create testcases for every data type and contract.


You can also feed our algorithm by simply clicking the datatypes or type them under 10 letters.


**Demo Time**


Check out our AI-generated test cases where we classify the data by our customized algorithms and then we generate test cases for you.

At the moment, we are doing a proper customer discovery whether this is what our customers want before scaling our app.


**Discount Time**


If you think that we solved your problem and saved your time, please reach out to us. We are happy to give you a 90% discount on our beta product so you can save huge on your testing budget.


However, if you still need a human tester to write more complex test cases, our testers can help you as well.


Either way, we can reduce your testing budget without losing your quality.
