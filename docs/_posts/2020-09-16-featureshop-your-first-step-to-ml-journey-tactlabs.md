Are you scared of PhD giants on Kaggle and not sure how to rank yourself up to get there?


Are you interested in Machine Learning and thinking of you solving the world’s toughest ML problem one day?


Are you tired of too many online courses and no real-time requirements to play with?


Fear Not!


We’ve got your back! At Featurepreneur we have created the first step volunteering community in Machine Learning — where you can solve employers’ small ML problems and get appreciated with a small amount of money and a recommendation letter.


Yes! Instead of dreaming of Kaggle’s 10,000$ competition, you can start with a 2$ problem in Machine Learning which might a small fix for our employers. Not only you can start cashing out the pocket money and also, but you will also rank up to get 10,000$ by solving big problems (hope you will get there soon).


**How does FS work?**


You will have to sign up, log in, and start looking at the ML requirements or any other data cleaning, analytics requirements. By default, the prize amount and the employer details will be hidden. Once you finished the requirements and if the employer likes your work, your prize amount will be revealed in Tact Coins (like Google credits) — don’t worry, this is not Bitcoin!


**Spin the Wheel and Cash-out — Weekly**


Every week, we will invite all top coin holders for the Spin the Wheel and Cash-out event. If you have accumulated enough coins, you will be invited by email. Spin the Wheel event will happen on the weekend and your name will be paper like in this wheel image below.

If you are lucky to win for the week, you will be eligible to cash out or convert it to a gift card.


If you don’t win on the Wheel-Spin for the 7 consecutive weeks, your cash will be automatically delivered it to you.

**Are you an Employer?**


Not everyone can afford a 100,000$ Data Scientist or ML Engineer. That’s why we came up with an ML volunteering community where ML enthusiasts can solve your ML / Data Analytics / MLOps problems.


You don’t need to make any financial contract with those volunteers and worry about losing money for nothing. You can just share the small ML problem you have that you desperately want a solution. Once our volunteer delivered it properly, you can give ’em a small amount of money or a recommendation letter (we have a recommendation letter template for you to help as well).


Also, we do have dedicated ML Engineers to solve your bigger problems. Our ML engineers and data scientists can come up with a better model with a scalable architecture.
