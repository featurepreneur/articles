summary: Spread the ML with Featurepreneur
---

Featurepreneur is a step towards creating a volunteering community in Machine Learning â€” where you can solve employersâ€™ small ML problems and get appreciated with a small amount of money and a recommendation letter.
This initiative was created to motivate young minds to showcase their technical talents and skills and also be benefitted from the same.

Featurepreneur is actually a kind of marketplace where you can propose your idea which would benefit the employer or society in any way. There is also a ReqBank- the requirements bank where there is a pool of requirements posted by the one who needs the feature and you can also choose one out of them and work on it.

**Technology Stack Required to be a part of Featurepreneur**

The main domain concentrated is machine learning and deep learning or some trending technologies. Initial training will be provided for a newbie in those technology stacks if required.

**A distinct attribute about featurepreneur**

Featurepreneur is a voluntary based community. Anyone who is interested can work on a feature or propose new ideas in it. After completion of the feature, a certain amount will be paid to the developer based upon their work.

This is a platform where one can able to focus on learning by working on a feature rather than focusing on money, but will also be benefited by their work with the money they deserve at the end.

**Benefits I earned for featurepreneurðŸŽ‰**

I am being a final year CSE student and intern at TactLabs, I got an opportunity to work in this featurepreneur. I completed some features and also benefited from it. Throughout the process, there was full of learning. In the end, I was also paid for the same at the end. This boosted my confidence that I could also work and develop products.

I would thank Mr. Raja CSP Raman who is a founder of Tactii and Tactlabs, Canada, and laid the basis for this platform. He is a successful entrepreneur who motivates young minds to reach their dreams.

I would strongly recommend young developers to use this platform to showcase their skills and get benefited by improving your career growth curve.ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
