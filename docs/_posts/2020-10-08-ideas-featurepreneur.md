**FEATUREPRENEUR** is a marketplace for machine learning and data science projects. It’s similar to freelancing, but not exactly freelancing.

**My Personal View**

I am a final year student from the Computer Science Department. I have completed a small feature and earned 20 CAD. I am happy on earning money before the completion of my bachelor’s degree. I am very happy and waiting to complete more features.

Apart from the money, I have learned so much about the latest technologies and this has boosted my confidence and self-learning capacity.

I would strongly recommend you to take part in Featurepreneur and showcase your skills
