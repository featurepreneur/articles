We created a feature called Tact coins to manage history.

**Requirements üìÉ**
The requirement of the feature was to manage the history of coins awarded to each of the interns. The application should provide details such as the total coins got by the student, released coins, and the coins that are to be released.

**Why we choose this feature? üòÑ**

I choose this feature because we are building the feature for our own intern company. As a beginner, this feature is good to start with. Every weekend, we use to spin the wheel in order to distribute the coins. This would make me happy each weekend when we use it.

**My Team ‚õ≥Ô∏è**

My team is small, me and my friend Aishwarya Ramaswami are part of the feature. This feature made us learn and share our knowledge with each other. It was a great start for knowledge transfer. We were able to come up with many innovative ideas and added extra features in Tact Coins.

**Tech Stack üíª**

The tech stack we required for this feature was
* Flask
* SQLite basics
* HTML and CSS for frontend
* MongoDB

**Working Hours ‚è∞**

As we had basic knowledge in Flask, SQLite database, and front end which we had got from the internship, it took around 20 hrs. We were given 20% of working time to work in regular working hours, in addition to which in our own interest we spent more time working on the feature. We were new to MongoDb, but gradually we learned. We had two phases.

**Phases 2Ô∏è‚É£**

We had two phases for this feature. The first phase was to connect with the SQLite database. The next phase was to migrate it to MongoDB in the cloud. Finally had to deploy in the Heroku app.

**Tact Coins üí∞**

The tact coins given for this feature were 20 CAD. We shared among us. I felt really happy after we got to explore different databases. By now, we have gained confidence such that we can handle any database.

**Application üéì**
