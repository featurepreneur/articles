For those who don’t know about AMA, it’s an acronym for Ask Me Anything.

As a part of our Featurepreneur community nurturing initiative, we regularly bring ML Experts/Data Scientists from all over the world (from Toronto to Sydney) and have an AMA session with them for 20–30 minutes.

Here are the basic details about our AMA sessions:

**AMA session duration?**
20 minutes to 30 minutes (not more than that we promise)

**Possible dates for AMA?**
Usually, we conduct AMA sessions on the weekends. We find both mutual time between the guest and the audience (IST time).

**What kind of questions will be there in the AMA session?**
We follow the 70–30 model in our AMA which means 70% tech-related and 30% non-tech related questions.

Here are the sample questions from our previous AMA session with Tensorflow Certified Developer Jatin:

**Tech:**
1. Talk about your Tensorflow Developer Certificate Exam preparation.
2. What motivated you to write this certificate?
3. What are the special things you have seen in Tensorflow 2.x?
4. What are tips would you give to Tensorflow Developer Certificate aspirants?
5. What are the basic Machine Learning tips would you give to new students?
6. If you think of one improvement in Tensorflow 2.x, what would it be?
7. If not Tensorflow exam, which one would have picked?
8. What are the benefits of TensorFlow over other libraries?
9. Can I run Tensorboard without TensorFlow?
10. What is more important to you between the performance and accuracy of a model in ML-based on Tensorflow?
11. Difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch?

**Non-Tech:**
1. What is your favorite destination?
2. Tell us about your hobbies.
3. If you read any fiction/non-fiction books, you can talk about your favorite book.

**Got an ML Engineer for us?**

If you think of any ML Engineer that you want to be added to our next AMA session, please send a request to raja@tactii.com and we will reach them out on behalf of you.
