Everyone speaks containers now!


Yeah, you have heard that right! After our Uncle Docker teaches how to speak containers, everyone got interested in and speaks containers nowadays.


So, microservices become the new norms when you build an app. So, you can keep the services separate and don’t need to worry about what tech team you have.


You can build an app in any tech and put it as a microservice! Containerized services like ECS and Kubernetes helping us to ship it faster and CircleCI speeds up our process and deploy things quickly.


**Time for ML integration:**

Now, this is your time to convert your favorite Machine Learning Model into microservice.


Here comes MaaMs — Model as a Microservice!


Yes, you can convert your model with the help of the existing microservice framework and ship your model in a matter of minutes, rather than weeks — months.


At Tactii, we can help you convert your ML model into Microservice (of course scalable) and it can be ready to be shipped.


We stick with AWS FYI!
