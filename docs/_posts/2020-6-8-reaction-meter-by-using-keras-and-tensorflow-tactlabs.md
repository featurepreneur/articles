summary: Reaction Meter
---

You might know that nowadays people are watching Youtube videos like RowdyBaby and share their reactions to them.

[Rowdy Baby | American Girls Reaction | Maari 2 | DHANUSH | SAI PALLAVI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyfdOf4_PAY)


It becomes a trend and it gets more attention nowadays.


However, we can’t aggregate the data by going through all of these collections. It’s tiresome to go through all of these videos and get the score for videos like RowdyBaby.


We thought, why not creating a reaction meter so we can get the reaction score with a clear aggregation by using updated machine learning libraries like Keras and Tensorflow — Hence our feature “Reaction Meter”


We have created an inhouse algorithm which focuses more on custom variables and emit the score with variables like below:


```
{
   "happy":455,
   "neutral":454,
   "scared":28,
   "angry":26,
   "sad":25,
   "surprised":13
}


```

**Interested to test your short film or video?**


If you are interested to test your new video for the reaction test, you can reach us out. We will hire some Canadian/Indian general audience and do the expressions test with them and then give you the score.


With the help of our expression meter, you can understand how famous your video will get in the future.
