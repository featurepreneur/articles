summary: How to make long virtual sessions interesting 
---

Making long virtual sessions interesting is hard. But in @featurepreneur, we bring in interactive gaming sessions to make people more involved throughout the session.

We have some really cool add-ons to any meeting. Let’s have a look!

**1. ReadingBreak**

Here, an HBR article is shared and the candidates are given 5 minutes to read and understand. As time ends, they will be asked to discuss their opinions.
Generally, it helps you to improve your communication skills. You will also learn to put forward your opinions to a group of people.

**2. Error Scenarios**

Here, you are provided with errors and are asked to find the cause of the error.
It is so common that we come across errors while coding. But, the more errors you solve, the more confident you become.

**3. Random Research Scenario**

The participants are provided with a random word or phrase (eg. Dunning Kruger effect) and are asked to google the word and bring a related definition about the word.

**4. Random Tool Research**

This is similar to the previous one except that the name of a tool (eg. GraphQL) will be given to research and discuss with the mentors.

**5. American-Canadian Phrases**

Here, an American/Canadian phrase will be given. The one that comes up with exact meaning and usage wins points for the round. This helps them to learn and also understand new phrases.

**6. American TV Show Discussion**

This is all about watching a TV show episode and discussing the part which interests them the most.
It’s not only entertaining but also, helps one to learn communication and GD skills.

**7. Get to know one City (American/Canadian)**

Here, you will be given the name of any city, for which participants come up with some interesting facts about the city. This helps one to know different places and cultures.
Learn with fun! @featurepreneur
