> *Micro-prediction for everyone!*

Feature Shop rebranded to featurepreneur! New applicants are accepted by reference. Anyone who is interested in Featurepreneur can reach us out.

It is a market place for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
It is similar to freelancing but not exactly. Students propose their ideas to their dream company or any other higher authorities or also any working person can come up with the requirements with is related to ml or anything related to the given data sets. This is mostly for volunteers who don’t have that experience. Even students with 2–3 years of experience can join.

**Is it Freelancing?**

It is no and yes. I would not say it is freelancing. Freelancing means someone will post for a requirement and the employee will know what we are going to work on and the price of the project. They will work for it and get the work done and the payment is given for the work.

**Who is the target audience?**

It can be anyone. For example, if a restaurant owner wants to some analysis or some micro prediction, they can reach us out. They can create requirements and post them. They don’t need to know completely about the ml and other stuff. Just the requirement is enough, and we make it for with volunteers

**Do give any specific training for students who don’t know anything about ML and Tech?**

Yes. We do have a separate program for ml learning basics and the technology basics. so we focus more on microservice and ml. Then we will teach all the students of their interest to engage with featurepreneur and we do charge a little bit of money so the details are updated on our website.

**What is your unique selling point?**

We love to keep it as a volunteering basis and not freelancing. In freelancing, the buyer will give you the requirement and you work and bit and work and again bid. Here we post the requirements and anyone can take up and work on it and the price amount is kept secret and revealed.

**Talk about the payment system in Feature Shop?**

The payment is like 20$ min and can go up to $100 and goes on. We don’t want to put any restrictions on the maximum amount. So whoever working on it and when the product is done and the buyer is willing to get it, the employee will get a $20 of surety later the amount can go up to $200 or more. We just want to keep it as a surprise. The payment will be credited in 2–3 weeks depending upon the amount.

**Who can provide requirements in Feature Shop?**

anyone looking for a micro prediction or analysis or POC kind of work or any ml for you to show your senior person can give us the requirements.

**Talk about the ML training for Feature Shop?**

It is done for all who are in FS. They should have some portfolio of about ML that would be great. thus training can go up to 3 months max or if your good at it, you can immediately start doing it. We have a basic test. If you pass it, you will be eligible to work with us.

**Do you focus only on ML?**

Strictly 80% is focused on ml and 20% on data stuff

**What is MaaMs?**

ML as a microservice. Let’s say you having a data set you can convert it into MaaMs. Right now we are working on the flask and fast API. We also have Kubernetes. So once you know the model you can convert it into mams and then you can give the API to the buyers and verify your work

**What is MLOps?**

the same thing as MaaMs. what happens there happens here to

**What technologies are you focusing on Feature Shop?**

We focus more on Python and ML and like flask API, fast API, and anything related to microservices. Probably in the future, we might work on other technologies too if required

**Who can provide the requirements?**

Anyone can provide it. Even if you are a student and you dream about a company for example tesla, Netflix, a feature can be proposed and put in your portfolio and we will verify it and advertise.

**Can students propose a feature for their dream companies?**

Yes. But as long it is related to ML, MaaMs, etc, and proposes it to their dream company.

### **I’m a Featurepreneur!**

With this team, I made 3 features, where one was a Buzzer API which could hold up to n-number of participants with score poll. The other one was a Hospital pricing API where the price of hospitals is updated for the user and they can search according to their type from their place. The final one was more like a progress card where we track the performance of the student s and show their performance and scores. As a final year student of CSE, I am happy to be a part of these, and getting paid for my innovations was the happiest part. This makes me unique from other students as I get paid as I learn!
