## **Your “ IDEAS “ are important 💡 💭**

Each one of us has some technical ideas, which you would have wanted to deploy it. The ideas should not be classified as large or small but what you do by yourself is very important, which makes you happy, proud and satisfied.

## **My Personal View 😄**

I am a Final year student and belong to the Computer Science Department. I have completed two features, one huge data collection related to upcoming technology and another one is to create an application to maintain the payment records. I have earned 30 CAD. This means so much to me, you are able to earn before completing your degree. I am really happy and this brings me the confidence to face the industry.

Other than money, I have learned about various technologies and new things like Flask, Web scrapping, Data Visualization, Scrapy, Selenium, and so on. I recommend you all to at least give a try even if you don’t know.

## **Nobody knows everything, but we can learn it !!!
Believe in you !!! ⭐️**

Let’s Grow Together 😍
