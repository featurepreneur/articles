Featurepreneur is a platform for Developers and Enthusiasts especially students. This initiative was created to motivate young minds and to create opportunities for them to express their technical talents and skills.

**Featurepreneur —The Market Place**

Featurepreneur is actually a marketplace where one can propose innovative projects or features to any companies in this platform or else one can also create the feature based on the requirements available in the ReqBank(Request bank) of Featurepreneur. These requirements will be posted by companies or anyone who needs a feature.

**Requirements — Technology stack**

Requirements posted in ReqBank will be mostly based on Machine Learning, Deep Learning or any other trending technologies. Specific training in Machine Learning and Microservices will be provided for students and so they can learn the technology if they are not familiar with it.

**Team formation**

One can work in solo as a lone wolf or one can also work in a group. There is no restriction on the number of members in a group. Numbers do not matter, only the progress and result does.

**The payment system in Featurepreneur**

After completing a feature, one can get up to 200CAD(Canadian Dollar) or even more based on the quality and complexity of the work done. One can get a minimum of 20CAD per feature. This payment will be fixed by corresponding requirement providers.

**Uniqueness of Featurepreneur**

Featurepreneur is a Volunteer basis and not freelancing. Anyone can check the requirements and work on it. They will know the amount that they will receive for a feature only after completing that particular feature.

The payment amount will be hidden until the end to make the developers get surprised at the end. Another reason for hiding payment amount is one can able to focus on learning by working on a feature rather than focusing on money.

**Benefits for students**

Students can able to learn new and trending technologies while working on a feature. They can get random benefits after completing the features. Some can even get recommendations from a company.

**My personal view**

I’m a Final year Computer Science and Engineering student. I completed two small features and working on two more features. I had earned 70CAD so far. I’m so much happy that I’m earning money before completing my bachelor’s degree. I’m also so much excited that how much will I receive for my next two features.

Apart from money, I learned a lot of new things like Data visualization using Highcharts, Sentiment analysis, Flask(Python web framework), and so on. I also gained more confidence in me that I can also able to develop good quality products on my own.

I will highly recommend everyone take part in Featurepreneur if they got the opportunity to participate in this platform and work in features to express your skills to others.

Thanks for reading.
