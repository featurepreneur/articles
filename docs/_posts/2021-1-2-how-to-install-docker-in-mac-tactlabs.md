TL;DR version

```
wget https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/
```

After downloading it just double click the .dmg file. They will do the rest of the magic.


This docker app includes:

* Docker Engine
* Docker CLI client
* Docker Compose
* Notary
* Kubernetes
* Credential Helper

Verify Docker:

```
docker --version
Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b
```

Verify Docker-compose:

```
docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 8d51620a
```
Run a simple app with docker compose:

```
git clone https://github.com/tactlabs/php-docker-simple
docker-compose up
```
You could see the output like below:

```

Also, you can verify the app by checking in the browser
