Through this article , I am going to discuss the best features and functionality of Ubuntu and also how it changes the lifestyle of Coding . Our Team Sainadhakula, Sakthi and me got an Internship Opportunity at TactLabs . Before and After the Internship there are lot of changes in the way what we are doing . We switched from windows to ubuntu , We learnt the basic commands at the beginner stage and after we learnt a lot more about free software .


We knows that Windows rules the desktop market, although that is changing rapidly . Ubuntu provides us with freedom to choose how you want your own damn computer to work .Without some exception, we can do anything with Ubuntu system, we can also change the desktop environment and free to do anything with the OS . The main advantage of using Ubuntu is lots of development softwares and packages are ready to be installed right from the Ubuntu software Center which is free for many packages repositories .
